# (WIP) PurpleTeam

## What is it?
PurpleTeam is a free to use, WIP (Work in progress) Windows based process forensics tool!

## What can it do?
As of right now, it can gather basic file data: Size, location, process status, priviledge groups, and current loaded libraries!

## What is planed for it?
To be one of the most reliable forensic tools for Windows!

## What is the meaning behind the name?
In security, there are 2 main teams if you will... Red and Blue, Red is typically the pentesters / hackers, and Blue are the defenders.
Both teams play a role in increasing the security of a software product, and each side probably uses the same methods or even tools too aid them in discoveries.

So instead of being branded as a tool for 1 particular team, the name PurpleTeam simply means neutral as in either "team" can use and benifit from it... Red+Blue = Purple
